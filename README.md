# Assigment Description
You App will consist of two activities.
The first activity should act as a registration form, i.e, asking the user to enter information. you can choose any combination of information you like. However, your first activity should contain dynamically populated Spinner. Also your activity should contain six types of different views. Finally, in the first activity you should use LinearLayout.
When the user fills the information in the first Activity, and clicks on "Save", the data entered should be sent to the second activity to show a summary fo what the user entered.
You can choose any design and colors for the second activity. But make sure here to use ConstraintLayout.
You need to utilise unified Styls for your views.
Every student is free to choose the views, design, and colors he/she likes. But this means that no two students can have similar work.
